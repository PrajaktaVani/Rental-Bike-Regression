# Rental-Bike-Regression
This project aims to predict the number of bikes rented per hour/day based on various environmental and seasonal factors. The goal is to help rental companies optimize bike availability, reduce shortage/surplus, and improve customer experience.
Objectives
Understand patterns in weather, seasonality, and user behavior
Clean and prepare a real-world dataset
Train and evaluate regression models
Predict future rental demand
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Machine Learning (Regression Models)
🔍 Steps Performed
Loaded and explored dataset (EDA, distributions, correlations)
Cleaned data (handled missing values, outliers, scaling)
Feature engineering (date-time split, season encoding)
Trained ML models — Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
Evaluated model performance — R², RMSE
Predicted rental demand for future time periods
📈 Result
Best model achieved high accuracy (R² score) and provided reliable predictions for rental demand during different seasons and weather conditions.
